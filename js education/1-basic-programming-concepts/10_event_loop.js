/**

 In JavaScript, the event loop is a mechanism for executing code in a non-blocking way,
 allowing for efficient handling of I/O operations and other asynchronous tasks.

 Unlike some other programming languages, JavaScript is single-threaded,
 meaning that it can only execute one task at a time. However,
 JavaScript does support asynchronous programming through the use of callback functions and the event loop.

 The event loop is responsible for managing the execution of tasks in JavaScript.
 It maintains a callback task queue, which contains tasks that are waiting to be executed.
 When a task is added to the queue, the event loop will execute it as soon as the call stack is empty.

 In addition to the event loop, JavaScript also has support for multi-threading through the
 use of Web Workers. Web Workers are a type of JavaScript thread that can be used to execute code in the background,
 allowing for more efficient processing of computationally intensive tasks.

 In summary, the event loop is a key component of JavaScript's asynchronous programming model,
 allowing for efficient handling of I/O operations and other asynchronous tasks.
 While JavaScript is single-threaded, it does support multi-threading through the use of Web Workers.
